    <h1>Question-1: Difference between map, filter , find , forEach ??</h1>
    <h2>Answer :</h2>
    <h3>
        <u>map:</u> This method is used to iterate over each element of an array, apply a function to each element,
        and return a new
        array with the results. <br>
        <u>filter:</u>This method is used to iterate over each element of an array and return a new array containing
        only the
        elements
        that satisfy a certain condition. <br>
        find: This method is used to find the first element in an array that satisfies a certain condition, and return
        that
        element. <br>
        <u>forEach:</u> This method is used to iterate over each element of an array and perform some action on each
        element.
        It
        doesn't return a new array, and it doesn't modify the original array <br>

        forEach is used to iterate over an array and perform an action on each element, while map and filter are used to
        transform an array into a new array with modified or filtered elements. find is used to search for a specific
        element in
        an array based on a certain condition.

    <h1>Question-2: Difference between local storage , session storage , cookies ??</h1>
    <h2>Answer :</h2>
    <h3>
        JavaScript provides three mechanisms for storing data on the client cookies, session storage, and local
        storage. Each
        one has advantages and disadvantages. <br>

        <u>Local storage</u> is the most recent mechanism. It allows for larger amounts of data to be stored, but the
        data is
        not
        deleted when the browser is closed. Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access
        later,
        such as offline data. <br>

        <u>Session storage</u> is similar to cookies, but the data is only stored for the current session. This means
        that the
        data
        will be deleted when the user closes the browser. Session storage is useful for storing data that is sensitive,
        such as
        login credentials. <br>

        <u>Cookies</u> are the oldest and most well-known mechanism. They are simple to use and well supported by
        browsers.
        However,
        they are limited to 4KB of data and are often used to store data that is not sensitive, such as user
        preferences.

    <h1>Question-3: What is eventLoop ? how does it work?</h1>
    <h2>Answer :</h2>
    <h3>

        The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that processes and dispatches events in a loop. It continuously
        checks for
        events in the event queue, picks them up, and passes them to the relevant event handler for processing.
        Asynchronous
        operations are handled by the browser environment, and when they complete, they're placed in the event queue as
        new
        events. The event loop allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations efficiently without blocking the main
        thread.
